Native database type attributes is a preview feature in 2.11.0. Type attributes **enrich your schema** with information about the underlying native database type.

In the following example, the `String` fields map to a `varchar` with different character limits in the underlying database:

```prisma
model Post {
  authorId                   Int?     @db.Int
|   content                    String?  @db.VarChar(1000)
  id                         Int      @id @default(autoincrement()) @db.Int
  published                  Boolean  @default(false) @db.TinyInt
|   title                      String   @db.VarChar(191)
}
```

In a future release, [Prisma Migrate support for type attributes](#prisma-migrate-not-yet-supported) will give you greater control over exactly which types are created in the underlying database.

## Enable native database type attributes

To enable native database type attributes:

1. Update the `generator` block in your schema as shown:

    ```prisma file=prisma/schema.prisma
    generator client {
        provider        = "prisma-client-js"
    |    previewFeatures = ["nativeTypes"]
    }
    ```

1. Introspect your database to populate the schema with type attributes:

   ```terminal
   npx prisma introspect
   ```

1. Generate Prisma Client:

    ```terminal
    npx prisma generate
    ```

## Additional Prisma types

The type attribute preview feature includes the following new Prisma types:

* `Decimal`
* `Bytes`
* `BigInt`

## Limitations

### Prisma Migrate not yet supported

Prisma Migrate does not yet support native database type attributes. If you try to `prisma migrate` or `prisma db push`, you will see the following error:

```terminal
Response "Some of the requested preview features are not yet allowed in migration engine. Please remove them from your data model before using migrations. (blocked: `nativeTypes`)"
```

### <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode> not yet supported

`db push` uses the migration engine, which does not support native database type attributes yet.

### SQL Server not yet supported

You cannot use native database type attributes with the [SQL Server preview](sql-server).
